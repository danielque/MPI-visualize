# MPI-visualize

A simple example demonstrating the MPI client/server interface. The mpi-compute program acts as a server and generates time-dependent data. The mpi-visualize program acts as a client and visualizes the computed data as a 2D color map using [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com).
